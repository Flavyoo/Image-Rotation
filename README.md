# Image-Rotation
Extra credit assignment for my Linear Algebra class of Spring 2017 at UMass Boston. This assignment focused on the application of matrices to produce rotations.
* Image files are read using GrayImage.java, therefore Rotate.java needs GrayImage to run properly.
* Large Images over 400px in width or height are scaled to half their size for faster rotation animation.
* When an Image is saved, it is saved to the current directory.
